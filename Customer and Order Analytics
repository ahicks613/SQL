In this SQL I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JANSALES;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE PRODUCT = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
JOIN FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT  product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revnue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(feb.quantity*feb.price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity > 2;

8. List all the product sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT  product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like'%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
