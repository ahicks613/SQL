#In this SQL, I'm querying a table to answer questions about Superbowl stats. 

#1. What was the highest number of points scored by winning team?
SELECT MAX(Winner_Pts) from superbowls;

#2. How many aver points did the losing team score?
SELECT ROUND (AVG (Loser_Pts)) from superbowls;

#3. What was the lowest number of points scored by winning team?
SELECT MIN (Winner_Pts) from superbowls;

#4. What is the lowest number of points scored by the winning team?
SELECT Winner, COUNT (Winner) AS "#_wins" from superbowls GROUP BY Winner HAVING "#_wins" >= 4;

#5. Assign an excitement level given the total points scored in the game.
SELECT SB, Winner,
     CASE 
     WHEN SUM(Winner_Pts+Loser_Pts) > 70 THEN "fun"
     WHEN SUM(Winner_Pts+Loser_Pts) > 60 THEN "average"
     WHEN SUM(Winner_Pts+Loser_Pts) > 50 THEN "fair"
     ELSE "boring"
     END AS "excitement_level" 
     FROM superbowls
     GROUP BY sb;
     
#6. Find superbowls where the final score of winning team was 30 or greater and losing team was 10 or less.
SELECT SB, Winner_Pts, Loser_Pts
FROM superbowls
WHERE Winner_Pts>=30 AND Loser_Pts<=10
ORDER BY Winner_Pts DESC;
