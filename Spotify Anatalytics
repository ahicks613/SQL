# The Spotify data for this project came from Kaggle.
# I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Who are the 10 most popular artists?
SELECT popularity, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2. How many different artists appear in the top 50?
SELECT COUNT(distinct artist_name) as 'Top 50 Artists'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#3. What artists are on the top 50 and how often do they each appear?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#4. How dancable is a song?
SELECT track_name as Song,
CASE
        WHEN danceability > .85 THEN 'put on dancing shoes'
        WHEN danceability > .75 THEN 'start swaying'
        WHEN danceability > .65 THEN 'at least get off the chair'
        ELSE 'keep watching tiktok'
END AS Do_I_Dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC;

#5. What is the average popularity for each artist in the Top 50?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, AVG(popularity)as AVG_Popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#6. Which artist(s) has/have the most tracks in top 50 and how many do they have?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_id) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata artist
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY COUNT(track_id) DESC
LIMIT 2;

#7. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#8. What is the average danceability, popularity & energy by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name,AVG(danceability), AVG(popularity), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#9. Using a CTE, calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH artist_popularity AS(
    SELECT s.artist_name as name, AVG(s.popularity) AS popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT name, popularity, 'Top Star' as Tag
FROM artist_popularity
WHERE popularity >=90
