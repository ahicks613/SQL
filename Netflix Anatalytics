In this SQL code I'm querying a database that holds Netflix information to answer questions about the data.

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? 
SELECT COUNT (type)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director.director, title.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" director
ON title.show_id = director.show_id
WHERE title.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie' 
ORDER by release_year ASC
LIMIT 2;
